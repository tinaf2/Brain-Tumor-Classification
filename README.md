# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-ML
In this project, neural networks are trained to classify tumors in brain MRI scans. Different neural network architectures are constructed through transfer learning and custom convolutional layers, and uses the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM to generate explanation's for the model's predictions.
